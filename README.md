## üöÄ Use

IMPORTANT NOTES:
    -This GUI does NOT save change automatically to allow testing without altering the data files each time.
        Make sure to click on the SAVE button (located at the main window) if you want to save any changes.
    -Ensure that Qt Creator is configured to create the build folder inside the project's directory (./build) rather than a parent directory (../build). So that CSV                 files can be accessed correctly.

1. **Login Window**:

When you first start the application, make sure to login with one of these users: (You can remove them later)

You can also sign up as a new REGULAR user.

Note that admins have some extra privileges: adding/editing/deleting resources, editing/deleting users, adding/deleting emails, sending emails, adding an event, and editing the opening schedule.

Also new users should follow these rules regarding their usernames and passwords:
